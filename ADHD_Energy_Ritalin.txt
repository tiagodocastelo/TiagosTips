ADHS, Energy and Ritalin

Every day you wake up with a given charge of mental energy. 
This energy is depleted during the day by every decision you take. (Roy F. Baumeister Willpower book)

The longer it takes to decide something (because you turn it around in your brain), the more energy is burned uselessly.

ADHS Brain
==========

Step 1: You want to do something. (Let's suppose you have a todo list with things)
Step 2: You turn it around in your head, bad feelings, pro & cons, but don't actually act on it.
Step 3: You finally commit to starting it.
Step 4: You need 20-30 minutes to immerse in the task.
Step 5: You continue working, but behold any distraction or minor roadbump which throws you offtrack.

Steps 2-4 consume the most energy (the overcoming off inner resistance), make you waste a lot of time, and if you're thrown out of the work by distraction or difficulty, you're back to Step 4 and consuming a lot of energy before getting anything done again.

Over the years, having read every book on motivation, tried every technique, and having found some workarounds, I somehow managed to along with the way my brain was working. Everything always was an energy depleting struggle.

But it always took enormous quantities of energy, and somehow over the years the energy tank has grown bigger and more efficient, just to reach below average functioning levels. 

With time, the energy tank in an AD-brain can hold more energy than a NT-brain, but Steps 2-4 use most of it, so that at the end Step 5 has less energy available than a NT-brain for the same task.
The AD-brain is underperforming. 

The AD-brain over the course of (Current age - 15 ) (15 because that's probably where the brain had to start adapting because of it's different way of functioning), so in my case the AD-brain has had roughly 40 years to adapt and build a big enough energy tank to somehow function almost normally.

There's a big reservoir of energy available every day, but most of it gets wasted away.

RITALIN enters the chat
=======================
Steps 2-4 are suddenly eliminated. No more energy wasted.

Step 1: You want to do something.
Step 5: You start with it and keep on it.

Even if distracted, you can easily come back to job, and if you decide to switch to another activity, you can immediatly start doing it. 

The most energy consuming Steps 2-4 gone away, you have the full energy available for the task at hand.

Add this to an oversized energy tank from 40 years of adapting, and suddenly you switch from generally underperforming to max overperforming. 

And the boost from the sudden realization that it's not one's flawed personality which
